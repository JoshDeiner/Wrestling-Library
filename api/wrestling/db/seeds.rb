  "description": "Wrestling as much as any sport requires a special type and level of courage. The arduous training, periodic weight cutting, and public arena for performing are challenges that intimidate all but a special breed of athlete. And that is not to mention the sports very essence: facing off against an opponent who wants to do nothing less than dominate you physically, destroy you emotionally, and humiliate you mentally.",
